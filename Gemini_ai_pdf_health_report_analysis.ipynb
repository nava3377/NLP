            "\n",
            "**1. WIDAL Test:** This test checks for antibodies against *Salmonella Typhi* and *Salmonella Paratyphi*, bacteria that cause typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever.  The results are expressed as dilutions.  A higher number indicates a stronger immune response (meaning the body is fighting the infection).  In this case:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **S. Typhi \"O\" 1:160:**  A significantly elevated antibody level suggesting a possible past or current typhoid infection.\n",

            "* **S. Paratyphi \"A\" 1:20:** Within the normal range, suggesting no current or recent paratyphoid A infection.\n",
            "* **S. Paratyphi \"B\" 1:20:** Within the normal range, suggesting no current or recent paratyphoid B infection.\n",
            "\n",
            "**2. Dengue Serology:** This tests for dengue fever, a mosquito-borne viral infection.  All three tests (NS1 antigen, IgG, and IgM) are negative, meaning no evidence of current or recent dengue infection.\n",
            "\n",
            "**3. Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR):** This measures how quickly red blood cells settle in a test tube.  A high ESR often indicates inflammation in the body. Mr. Goud's ESR is elevated (26 mm/hr in the first hour, 52 mm/hr in the second), suggesting the presence of inflammation.\n",
            "\n",
            "**4. Rapid Malaria Test:** This test screens for malaria parasites in the blood. Both *Plasmodium vivax* (P.V.) and *Plasmodium falciparum* (P.F.) are negative, indicating no malaria infection.\n",
            "\n",
            "**5. Complete Blood Picture (CBC):** This provides a detailed analysis of the blood cells:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Hemoglobin (Hb):** 13.6 g/dL (within the normal range), measures the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood.\n",
            "* **Red Blood Cells (RBC):** 4.3 million/cumm (slightly below the normal range but not significantly low).\n",
            "* **White Blood Cells (WBC):** 7,200 cells/cumm (within the normal range), part of the immune system.\n",
            "* **Platelet Count:** 2.0 lakhs/cumm (within the normal range), important for blood clotting.\n",
            "* **Packed Cell Volume (PCV):** 40.5% (within the normal range), the percentage of red blood cells in the blood.\n",
            "* **Differential Count:** This breaks down the types of white blood cells. All are within or near the normal ranges.\n",
            "* **Peripheral Blood Smear:**  A microscopic examination of the blood; the report indicates that the red and white blood cells and platelets appear normal.\n",
            "\n",
            "**6. HbA1c:** This test measures average blood sugar levels over the past 2-3 months. Mr. Goud's level is 5.4%, which falls within the normal range for non-diabetics, indicating good blood sugar control.\n",
            "\n",
            "**7. Serum Creatinine:** This measures kidney function. Mr. Goud's level is 0.8 mg/dL (within the normal range), indicating normal kidney function.\n",

            "**8. Random Blood Glucose:** This measures blood sugar level at a random time. Mr. Goud's level is within the normal range.  The specific value is missing from the report.\n",

            "\n",
            "* **Total Bilirubin, Direct Bilirubin, Indirect Bilirubin:** All within normal ranges, indicating normal liver function related to bilirubin processing.\n",
            "* **Alkaline Phosphatase:** Slightly below the normal upper limit,  generally indicating normal liver function.\n",
            "* **SGOT (AST) and SGPT (ALT):**  Both are within normal limits, further indicating normal liver function.\n",
            "* **Total Protein and Albumin:** Within normal ranges.\n",
            "* **Globulin:**  A component of total protein; the result is provided, but the reference range is missing.\n",

            "* **Sodium:** Slightly below the normal range, it would be wise to consult a doctor for further investigation.\n",

Otherwise, most of the other test results are within normal ranges, indicating generally good health.  **It is crucial that Mr. Kishan Goud discuss these results with his doctor, Dr. Krishna Prasad, for proper interpretation and further medical advice.**  The slightly low values need attention, and the possible typhoid infection needs to be investigated further.\n",
