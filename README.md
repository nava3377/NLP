## 🧠 What This Project Is About

This project includes solutions and code examples for core NLP tasks such as:
- **Text preprocessing** (tokenization, normalization)
- **Feature extraction** (bag-of-words, TF-IDF)
- **Text classification or sentiment analysis**
- Handling datasets and preparing text data

This repository reflects my journey in understanding how computers interpret and process human language.
